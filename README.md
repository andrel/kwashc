# Kantega Web Application Security Hero Challenge (kwashc) #

## About ##

Developed for an in house training challenge for employees. The main goals with the challenge was to educate developers
about security risks for web applications.

The concept is to give all the participants the Java code for a simple blog implementation (webapp project). Then each
participant or team registers their blog application on the server. The server then tests a set of know security risks
against the application. While learning about security risks, the participant are challenged to fix them, with help
both from the test server and the ones holding the challenge. The first participant or team to have all risks fixed
wins.

Fixing a risk does not necessarily mean the risk is completely removed, as both test and fix might not be correctly
implemented. Either way the challenge tries to educate and create awareness about each risk, which is the most important
part of the challenge.

The security risks are mostly based on the [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org). list, but a few additional risks have
also been added.
